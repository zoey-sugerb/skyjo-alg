# Skyjo Algorithm
This project aims to implement the game Skyjo in Fortran, alongside a game theory-based algorithm for a computer player.

**Note**: This project was created as a way for me to learn Fortran, and as such may contain some things that are not best practices or the optimal way to do these things in Fortran.
